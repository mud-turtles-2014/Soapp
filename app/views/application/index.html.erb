    <p>State of the App is a great way for teams to view eachothers progress on a repository before it is even pushed to GitHub.
      <br><br>
      For a more synchronized work flow, users are able to attach a web hook to their local repository that will send every local commit and edit to SOAPP for team members to view.
      <br><br>
      Implementing SOAPP will evade potential merge conflicts and reduce an overlap in work.
